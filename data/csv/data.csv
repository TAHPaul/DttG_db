The lower layer is red and the upper layer is warm, brownish-gray (see MIC1). Based on the appearance in the X-ray, one or both of the ground layers was applied with a knife in broad arcing strokes generally oriented from upper right to lower left. Numerous scratches in the ground are visible in the X-ray and may be related to the application tool or to coarse particles from the ground that were dragged across the surface in the process of applying or smoothing the ground. Some of these scratches are visible microscopically in the upper ground layer and appear dark in the X-ray. Others appear more radio-opaque and may be scratches in the lower ground layer that were filled in when the second layer, which presumably contains lead white, was applied. Variations in the density of the ground around the edges seem to indicate the use of a different application technique or tool compared to the broad knife strokes that cover most of the canvas. This difference at the edges probably indicates that the canvas was prepared to size rather than cut from a larger piece of primed fabric. An intermittent shallow furrow or recess in the ground at approximately 2–2.5 cm from the edges of the canvas is visible on the surface of the painting in raking light and appears more radio-transparent in the X-ray. This also seems to be related to the ground application, possibly where the application tool came into contact with the inner edge of the strainer or priming frame; however, because the edges of the original canvas have been cut, there is no evidence of the original attachment."

Not sampled, so there may be a red first ground. Grey-brown ground visible from the surface- see photos from Boevé-Jones. From Steele at Cleveland Museum of Art: ""A thin light brown priming layer appears to be applied over the canvas support. Analysis with XRF in an area where the ground layer is more visible (see XRF locations 1) indicates the presence of lead white, iron, calcium and trace amounts of manganese, phosphorous, silicon, and copper. The same area in the X-ray reveals only a light amount of X-ray blocking lead white, suggesting that the ground layer is either quite thin and/or only contains a relatively small amount of lead white. A thin, toned underlayer or imprimatura appears to be applied directly over the ground."""

translucent brown particle in the ‘hump’ in the ground between the two sections of upper paint

brown?). A small amount of lead white was also confirmed. A translucent colourless particle at
the bottom left seems to be quartz (Si only). A spectrum collected over an area in the upper

This consists of a lower layer of ground, directly on the canvasm of red ochre and red lead in a medium with the characteristics of drying oil, with, above it, a thinner layer of a mixture of coarsely-ground lead white and charcoal black. This type of double ground had previously, and has since, only been noted on pictures by Rembrandt or by his immediate followers. No. 6347 dates however from 1624 before Rembrandt had reached maturity or achieved the fame he was to have in Amsterdam in the early 1630's. The double priming is decribed by Felibien (the biographer of Rembrandt) in his 'Des princupes de l'Architecture, Sculpture, Peinture...' of 1776, though merely giving instructions as to how this type of preparation may be made, and not with any particular reference to techniques of any artist or school in particular."""

From Helen Howard: Initial preparation of the canvas support consists of a ground of earth pigments (including particles of silica and aluminosilicates) with a little lead white, calcium carbonate and carbon black. The ground has been applied in two layers, the lower slightly darker brown in colour (S 19).
Over this is a pale grey layer of lead white combined with finely ground black pigment, red lead and alumino silicates and translucent particles (soaps). The pale grey, lead-based layer varies in thickness. SEM/EDX analysis confirmed the presence of chlorine associated with lead in the grey ground. This is likely to be leadhydroxy/chloride-carbonate, a chlorinated lead mineral phase in the lead soap aggregate (see Keune 2005)."
