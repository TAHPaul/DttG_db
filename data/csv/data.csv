M045,1,1. Dark brown ground,DB,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,Marcia Steele,"Emailed from Marcia Steele, senior paintings conservator",,"Gerrit van Honthorst, A Boy Blowing on a Firebrand (1620–22): The plain-weave canvas was primed with a double ground layer. The lower layer is red and the upper layer is warm, brownish-gray (see MIC1). Based on the appearance in the X-ray, one or both of the ground layers was applied with a knife in broad arcing strokes generally oriented from upper right to lower left. Numerous scratches in the ground are visible in the X-ray and may be related to the application tool or to coarse particles from the ground that were dragged across the surface in the process of applying or smoothing the ground. Some of these scratches are visible microscopically in the upper ground layer and appear dark in the X-ray. Others appear more radio-opaque and may be scratches in the lower ground layer that were filled in when the second layer, which presumably contains lead white, was applied. Variations in the density of the ground around the edges seem to indicate the use of a different application technique or tool compared to the broad knife strokes that cover most of the canvas. This difference at the edges probably indicates that the canvas was prepared to size rather than cut from a larger piece of primed fabric. An intermittent shallow furrow or recess in the ground at approximately 2–2.5 cm from the edges of the canvas is visible on the surface of the painting in raking light and appears more radio-transparent in the X-ray. This also seems to be related to the ground application, possibly where the application tool came into contact with the inner edge of the strainer or priming frame; however, because the edges of the original canvas have been cut, there is no evidence of the original attachment."

This consists of a lower layer of ground, directly on the canvasm of red ochre and red lead in a medium with the characteristics of drying oil, with, above it, a thinner layer of a mixture of coarsely-ground lead white and charcoal black. This type of double ground had previously, and has since, only been noted on pictures by Rembrandt or by his immediate followers. No. 6347 dates however from 1624 before Rembrandt had reached maturity or achieved the fame he was to have in Amsterdam in the early 1630's. The double priming is decribed by Felibien (the biographer of Rembrandt) in his 'Des princupes de l'Architecture, Sculpture, Peinture...' of 1776, though merely giving instructions as to how this type of preparation may be made, and not with any particular reference to techniques of any artist or school in particular."""
